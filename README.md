# Playwright + TypeScript Automation Framework Design

The goal is to create an automation framework that is:

---

## ðŸš€ Scalable

- **Folder & file structure**  
  Use a consistent structure (`tests/`, `pages/`, `components/`, `utils/`, `data/`, etc.) to avoid clutter as the test suite grows.

- **Environment configs**  
  Use a `config.ts` setup that allows switching between environments via CLI or CI variables.

- **Test data management**  
  Avoid hard-coded data; use fixtures or external JSON/CSV files.

- **CI/CD integration**  
  Ensure it can plug into pipelines easily (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).

---

## ðŸ”„ Flexible

- **Supports multiple test types**  
  Framework should support **UI**, **API**, and **E2E** tests.

- **Configurable runtime settings**  
  Base URL, timeouts, and retries should be easily overridden using CLI flags or `.env` files.

- **Tags and filtering**  
  Leverage test annotations (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`) and CLI filters for selective test execution.

---

## ðŸ§± Modular

- **Page Object Model (POM)**  
  Follow the POM design pattern for clear separation between test logic and page structure.

- **Component abstraction**  
  Extract reusable UI parts (e.g., modals, nav bars) as subcomponents or page fragments.

- **Utility files**  
  Place common helpers (date formatters, API clients, file parsers) in dedicated utility modules.

- **Avoid test code duplication**  
  Use shared methods for setup/teardown, validations, and data generation.

---

## ðŸ”Œ Extensible

- **Plugin-friendly architecture**  
  Design the framework so new tools or services can be added easily (e.g., API testing support, DB access, cloud device labs).

---

## ðŸ“Š Allows for Effective Monitoring and Reporting

**Considerations:**

- **HTML reports**  
  Use Playwright's built-in reporter or integrate Allure/HTML/JSON reporting tools.

- **Custom logs**  
  Implement structured logging with timestamps, test context, and screenshots.

- **Analytics (optional)**  
  Consider tools that can visualize test performance, flakiness, or pass rate trends over time.
